          <p>
            Drumming has been my preferred form of expression since I was 10. Sitting down at my first drum set, sticks
            in hand, I remember a sense of exhilaration while discovering all the sounds that could be made with just a
            handful of drums and cymbals. The physicality of it was cathartic and left me feeling relaxed and satisfied.
            I only recently learned that drumming actually impacts your

          <h3>Video Editing</h3>
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/videoEditing.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            Editing can make or break a story. It sets the tone, controls the mood, and deliberately guides the viewer's
            emotions through every twist and turn. According to Alfred Hitchcock, "creation is based on an exact science
            of audience reactions" so anticipating audience expectations is key. Editing is a series of tiny, calculated
            choices that either add to or take away from the journey; a good editor is empathetic enough to tell the
            difference. The next time you watch your favorite movie you can thank the editors for thinking of you.

            I love games! Its a great chance to unwind, goof around with friends and familiy, and keep your mind sharp.
            Games are proven to increase your muscle control, memory, perception, and spatial navigation. From board
            games to video games, you can boost your brain's grey matter just by playing more.

          <span class="image main"><img src="images/greatTree.png" alt="" /></span>
          <p></p>
          <p class="call">
            <strong>Long ago,</strong>
            deep in the mountains, perched atop the highest cliff, where the Wind howled and raged in protest, there
            lived a Tree. She was one of the Great Trees, reaching dangerously, rebelliously into the face of the Wind
            and right over the cliff’s edge. Strong and beautiful. But beautiful is too shallow a word for her. This
            Tree had true Beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tree lived upon the cliff for as long as anyone can remember. Some say hundreds, perhaps thousands of
            years. It was a hard life for the Tree, who was relentlessly battered and beaten by the Wind. Her leaves
            were ripped and sparse, her branches broken and twisted, her trunk knotted and gnarled. But all those who
            knew the Tree said her Beauty was something that could be felt. It would resonate inside you like the
            vibrous rumble of thunder, or when one hears the truth spoken after years of lies. Whispers of hope spread,
            saying that the Tree even gave Beauty to those who journeyed to see her.
          </p>
          <p>
            One by one they sought out the Tree hoping she would reveal some secret to becoming beautiful. But they were
            each surprised. For when they approached the Tree their minds were silenced by the weight of all her years,
            the sorrow of all her scars, the power of her steady strength, the joy of all her outstretched branches. But
            what they remembered most of all was feeling their burdens lift and their lies fall away at being seen by
            the Tree. She could see and feel many things from high up on the cliff, and knew many things. But the Tree
            did not use this to cast judgement on them. Instead, she lent them her sight and shamelessly shared with
            them her wounds and scars. It was in the Tree’s acceptance and openness that the people felt her saying ‘I
            see You, and You are Enough’. This, above all else, compelled them to go see the world, and themselves,
            anew. In this way, the people’s adoration of the Tree spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            But all this time the Wind was there watching, trying to dissuade the people from climbing the steep path up
            the cliff. Seeing the people adore her Strength and Beauty made him jealous. Couldn’t they see through
            her lies?
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am the one who ripped her leaves, broke her branches and twisted her trunk!”, wailed the Wind. “I am the
            one they should be thanking! I am the one they should adore! If they think she is beautiful because of her
            strength to survive then I will show them what <em>real</em> strength it took to create that accursed Tree in the first place!
            If strength and power they love then soon I will make them bow to me!”, howled the Wind as he rushed away.
          </p>
          <p>
            That night, the Wind gathered himself up from every direction and spun into a terrible storm. The sky grew
            black and the clouds swirled high overhead. Lightning flashed and thunder bellowed across the land. It was
            the most terrible, most desperate Storm the people had ever seen. Far below the cliff, the Tree saw only
            darkness torn by flashes of blinding light. She watched helplessly as the destruction of the village came
            like images. Devastation spreading one glimpse at a time. The villagers ran for cover and cowered from the
            Wind against the base of the cliff, kneeling and bowing down to the ground with their arms over their heads
            for protection. The Wind stripped away nearly all of Tree’s leaves, and many of her branches were cracked
            and broken. Some of them would surely die. Others might eventually heal, leaving behind more knots and
            scars. The storm raged on for most of the night until the Wind finally tired. Having spent his rage he blew
            away to rest, leaving behind the rain and clouds who slowly wandered off without the Wind’s great strength
            to hold them together.
          </p>
          <p>
            By morning the land was quiet and calm. The clouds were now gone and the sun peered over the edge of the
            distant mountains, oblivious to what the Wind had done. The Tree reached out her broken branches towards the
            Sun’s gaze. She saw the people below gathering their scattered things trying to figure out how to return
            their lives to what they once were. She was surprised to see a young woman approaching who had stumbled her
            way up the path to the top of the cliff.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman sat on a dead stump nearby — there were more of those now. She placed her head in her hands and
            began weeping. Her shoulders shook and she gasped for breath between sobs. After a time she sat up and
            stared out at the sky, wet and shivering. She told Tree how her family was lost in the storm, how her home
            was destroyed, and how she was left with nothing. As she finished speaking, drops of water warmed by the sun
            gently showered her, falling like tears from Tree’s few remaining leaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually the young woman rose and walked away. At the edge of the clearing she turned to the Tree and said
            “Thank you, Great Tree, for giving me hope all these years. If you can live in the face of this Wind,
            perhaps I can too.” With that, she turned and left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile the Wind had returned. He blew himself straight up to the tree and right into her branches.
            “Tree!,” screamed the Wind as he scowled, “I have blown off all your leaves, but you fight against me. I
            have broken many of your branches, and you continue to fight. I have bent and twisted your trunk, and even
            then you fight. I have destroyed many of your neighbors, but still you keep fighting! Why must you fight and
            defy me!?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fight?”, asked the Tree, seeming to just take notice of the Wind. “Fight? You do not threaten me anymore,
            Wind. When I was a sapling you wielded your power over me. With all your might you tried to destroy me. And
            you nearly did.” The Tree thought for a moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You have the entire sky to yourself, Wind. Why do you try to take this little bit from me? Why do you
            fight?”, she asked. The Wind did not answer. Instead he began to whirl and wail against the cliff rock,
            searching desperately for a crack to exploit, thrashing with all the rage of a wild beast.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My roots are deep and strong,” she said, “firmly anchored from years of effort, decades of intention,
            secure as stone. You cannot harm me. Of that I am certain.” The Tree rested calmly, leaning her broken
            branches toward the glow of the rising sun.
          </p>

          <p>Strength. Beauty.</p>

          <p>
            “I am sorry that you mistake my existence for defiance. I am a tree, Wind. Day by windy day, inch by broken
            inch, I simply grow towards the light. And you have no power over that.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She is one of the Great Trees. Strong and Beautiful. But she is not alone. If you look, you will find Great
            Trees everywhere.
